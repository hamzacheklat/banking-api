**Subject:** Request to expedite the processing of Entitlements for access to the Cassandra bastion

Hello everyone,

I have submitted entitlement requests to obtain access to the Cassandra bastion. Here are the details:

* **FR PAR ADM UNIX ADMIN-CASSANDRA ADMIN INF** on Unix Technical
* **EMEA CyberArk DBACASSANDRA User** on CyberArk Profile

Two of my requests are still in the “provisioning” and “waiting” status.

Would it be possible to expedite the processing of these requests so I can gain access to the bastion as soon as possible?
Indeed, the only developer currently having the rights (James Pic) is on leave, and I need to resume his work in case of bugs.

Thank you in advance for your feedback.

Best regards,
Hamza CHEKLAT
